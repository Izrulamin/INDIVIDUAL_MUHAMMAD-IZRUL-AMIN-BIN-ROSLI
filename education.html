    My primary school is at Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Gelugor ( SKSG ) . I am really happy to have my primary school here because this school is the oldest Malay school in Malaysia ( 1826 ) . There is lot of my families who also school here such as my father , my uncle and my sister . I am really grateful to have an opportunity to enjoy the old building infrastructure before the new building are completely finish on 2013 .  I can said I am the last batch that stay at old building before moving out to the new building . In addition , I still remember that all of the students especially standard 6 helped teachers to carry out things / materials / books to the new buildings . It was  a great experience because all of us enjoy doing that . My result is 3A 2B.

    My secondary school is at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bukit Gambir , Pulau Pinang . I think here is the place that I learn more about life such as friendship  , struggling for SPM , enjoy celebrating special days and many mores . Also , here I develop and build a lot of skills by holding a lots of position , joining variety of programs , and many more . Definitely , I will not forget the best moment that i have created here .

    Now , I studied at Universiti Teknologi Mara ( UITM ) Kedah . I take Diploma in Information Management ( IM110 ) . There are lots of things that I learnt and experience throughout my journey to finish my studies and graduate . Undeniable , there are lots new experience that touch/ covering all my feelings whether it is happy , sad , nervous , excitement , surprise and etc. After getting a result of UPU stated that I got Diploma in Information Management , I quite surprise because I really does not have any idea what this course will bring me to . However , until this final semester , I realized that this course is very interesting . Thus , if I have an opportunity , I would like to recommend this course to SPM candidates , STPM and etc. 
<br><br><br>

    However , everything change when Pandemic Covid â€“ 19  affected all of us . I only stay at campus for almost 1 semester and 1 month of 2nd semester on 2020. After that , we need to stay at home and continue our studies by online learning . At first , it is tough for doing assignment , discussion and etc. However , I managed to survived until today . Alhamdulillah . Now , i am a final student of Diploma in Information Management .
